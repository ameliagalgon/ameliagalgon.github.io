                <div class="title">The beginning of my path to becoming a web developer</div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I didn’t always think that I wanted to be a web developer. But I guess not many people have. My decision to work towards becoming one just started to piece together while I was in college. I graduated from Lehigh University in May 2017 with a degree in computer science, but even after I graduated I felt like I still had a lot to learn. Most of the projects that I had worked on gave me the opportunity to problem-solve and construct algorithms, but I thought that I was much more interested in human-computer interaction. I thought much more about design, usability, and visual appeal than I felt a lot of my peers did. While I loved the challenge of writing algorithms that would solve a problem, I didn’t have much incentive to program if the final product wasn’t something that a user would be excited to interact with.</p>
                    <p>I worked as a student web developer in college. I learned a lot there, but more than anything I gained exposure to a different side of computer science and coding. It showed me that programmers can work with clients to develop a site that not only worked but was something that the client was happy with. I loved the idea of programming to make content easy to navigate, accessible, and beautiful. I also liked the idea of the popularity of sites being totally dictated by unknown users. Content on the web had to be usable and easy to navigate for anybody and not just the people that created a site. More importantly, users needed to be engaged at all times in order to maintain their attention. I wanted to work on programming problems that were constantly incorporated with a user’s perspective and valued design as away to solve a problem. The being of my senior year of college was when I decided that becoming a Web Developer was going to be my goal when I graduated.</p>
                    <p>I made the decision to join Bloc not long before I graduated college and I started the Web Developer Track at the end of June that year. It’s been a lot of time commitment for me, but it’s been well worth it. The program has helped to guide me through learning the technology and thinking about my future career goals. It can be difficult sometimes. I had been doing a lot of painting while participating in the program and doing freelance work as well. On top of that I moved to Brooklyn, NY and started an internship at an art gallery/ collective. Even a couple month into to program, I know that this is just the beginning of my new journey.</p>
