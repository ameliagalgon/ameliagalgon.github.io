                <div class="title">Connecting Artists and a Unicorn</div>
                <div class="date">September 6, 2017</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>This week is my third week working in Lower East Side Manhattan at Con Artist Collective. I came across their internship program when I was still living in the Greater Philadelphia Area and was looking for a place that I could make art. I saw that they offered their venue to interns while they work there, so I joined. When I first visited the place I was drawn to the large, wooden box in the middle of the floor that covered in graffiti and doodles. The general manager told me that they called the space their office and when he took me inside there was a giant unicorn head made of aluminum foil. I had just seen the place for a few seconds, and that was when I fell in love with the space.</p>
                    <p>I started working there a week after I moved to Brooklyn. I jumped onto their development projects for their website and online forum that they call, CAMP. It is still towards the beginning of the internship, so most of work I have been doing has been learning how they manage their current website, understanding their future goals, and creating mockups for future versions of their online platforms. One of my goals is to brush-up on design, so having the opportunity to create mockups for an organization has been good for me. It’s not something that I have the time to do while I’m taking online classes. It has also given me practice in developing for a larger organization. I have had almost full control over most of my previous projects, so it becomes kind of fun to think about what a client/organization needs or wants and being able to come up with solutions that accomplish their goals. It’s nice to not have to think about every single aspect of an application and work on a team.</p>
                    <p>I have just begun working on a functional demo for their public website. After doing a lot of designing, it’s nice to be able to code again. I'm better at programming than web design. Haha.</p>

                <div class="title">My experience (so far) with Bloc</div>
                <div class="date">September 5, 2017</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Going into Bloc, I was admittedly a little apprehensive. I didn’t know if it was the best idea for me to jump into online classes right after getting a bachelor’s. At the time, I was dedicating most of my energy into painting and creating art and wanted to experiment working as a freelance artist. I thought, if anything, it would be a way to help me focus on developing my programming skills.</p>
                    <p>The more I work through the projects that are a part of the curriculum, the more excited I get about the program. I love to create and I am learning more than I expected. I just finished working through the first two projects that focus on the front end. At first it was a little difficult for me to comprehend all of the components of Angular, such as the types of services etc. However, after I was able to complete two projects using Angular, I felt like I had a better grasp of the framework. I think it is a good accomplishment considering I’ve only used it for a few weeks so far. I’m even taking what I’ve learn at block and using it in my new internship to build a dynamic website.</p>
                    <p>Since I’ve already learned so much so far, I am excited to move on to learning more about back-end development. Most of my prior experience before starting Bloc had been in front-end developing, so I think the next module will be more intense for me. I look forward to the challenge. I enjoy learning about web development and I like having the opportunity to take what I learn and apply it to other things that I’m doing.</p>

                <div class="title">The beginning of my path to becoming a web developer</div>
                <div class="date">September 4, 2017</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>I didn’t always think that I wanted to be a web developer. But I guess not many people have. My decision to work towards becoming one just started to piece together while I was in college. I graduated from Lehigh University in May 2017 with a degree in computer science, but even after I graduated I felt like I still had a lot to learn. Most of the projects that I had worked on gave me the opportunity to problem-solve and construct algorithms, but I thought that I was much more interested in human-computer interaction. I thought much more about design, usability, and visual appeal than I felt a lot of my peers did. While I loved the challenge of writing algorithms that would solve a problem, I didn’t have much incentive to program if the final product wasn’t something that a user would be excited to interact with.</p>
                    <p>I worked as a student web developer in college. I learned a lot there, but more than anything I gained exposure to a different side of computer science and coding. It showed me that programmers can work with clients to develop a site that not only worked but was something that the client was happy with. I loved the idea of programming to make content easy to navigate, accessible, and beautiful. I also liked the idea of the popularity of sites being totally dictated by unknown users. Content on the web had to be usable and easy to navigate for anybody and not just the people that created a site. More importantly, users needed to be engaged at all times in order to maintain their attention. I wanted to work on programming problems that were constantly incorporated with a user’s perspective and valued design as away to solve a problem. The being of my senior year of college was when I decided that becoming a Web Developer was going to be my goal when I graduated.</p>
                    <p>I made the decision to join Bloc not long before I graduated college and I started the Web Developer Track at the end of June that year. It’s been a lot of time commitment for me, but it’s been well worth it. The program has helped to guide me through learning the technology and thinking about my future career goals. It can be difficult sometimes. I had been doing a lot of painting while participating in the program and doing freelance work as well. On top of that I moved to Brooklyn, NY and started an internship at an art gallery/ collective. Even a couple month into to program, I know that this is just the beginning of my new journey.</p>
